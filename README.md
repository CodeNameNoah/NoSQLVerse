## Introducing NoSQLVerse API - Powering a Social Network Web Application

NoSQLVerse API is a robust and scalable backend built to support the NoSQLVerse social network web application. This API enables users to seamlessly share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and maintain a friend list. The API is built using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database for data storage, and the Mongoose ODM (Object-Document Mapper) for simplified database interactions.

The API leverages Express.js for handling HTTP requests and routing, providing a well-structured and maintainable codebase. MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is used to store and retrieve data efficiently. The Mongoose ODM simplifies database interactions by providing a schema-based solution for modeling application data.

To enhance the user experience, the API utilizes the Moment package to format timestamps, ensuring that dates and times are displayed in a user-friendly format.

NoSQLVerse API is a powerful backend solution for building social network web applications, providing users with a seamless and engaging experience while facilitating secure data management and real-time interactions.

For a detailed demonstration of NoSQLVerse's functionality, including user registration, thought sharing, reactions, and friend list management, a walkthrough video has been created. You can access the video further down below in this readme.md

## Key Features

Thought Management: Users can create, read, update, and delete their thoughts. The API handles thought CRUD operations, ensuring that only the authorized user can perform actions on their thoughts. Thoughts are stored in a MongoDB database, allowing for efficient retrieval and manipulation.

Reaction System: Users can react to their friends' thoughts by liking, disliking, or leaving comments. The API manages the reaction system, enabling users to express their feelings and opinions. The reaction data is stored alongside the thoughts, allowing for easy retrieval and aggregation.

Friend List Management: Users can create and manage their friend lists, enabling them to connect with other users on the platform. The API provides endpoints to add friends, remove friends, and retrieve the friend list of a user.
